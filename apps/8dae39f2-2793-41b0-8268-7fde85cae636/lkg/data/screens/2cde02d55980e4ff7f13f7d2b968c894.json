Important Disclosures: \u00a0Investing involves risk, including loss of principal.  \u00a0Past performance does not guarantee or indicate future results. \u00a0Please consider, among other important factors, your investment objectives, risk tolerance and Acorns pricing before investing. \u00a0 Diversification  and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit, nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal. \u00a0 It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  \u00a0Any  hypothetical performance  shown is for illustrative purposes only. Such results do not represent actual results and do not take into consideration economic or market factors which can impact performance. Actual clients may achieve investment results materially different from the results portrayed.  Round-Ups\u00ae  investments are transferred from your linked funding source (checking account) to your Acorns Invest account, where the funds are invested into a portfolio of selected ETFs. If you do not maintain an adequate amount of funds in your funding source sufficient to cover your Round-Ups\u00ae investments, you could incur overdraft fees with your financial institution. \u00a0Only purchases made with a funding source linked to your Acorns account with the feature active are eligible for the Round- Ups\u00ae feature. Please note that a properly suggested  portfolio recommendation  is dependent upon current and accurate financial and risk profiles. Clients who have experienced changes to their goals, financial circumstances or investment objectives, or who wish to modify their portfolio recommendation, should promptly update their information in the Acorns app or through the website.

Acorns reserves the right to restrict or revoke any and all offers at any time.  Acorns does not provide access to invest directly in Bitcoin . Bitcoin exposure is provided through the ETF BITO, which invests in Bitcoin futures. This is considered a high-risk investment given the speculative and volatile nature. Further information and risks available via the disclosure link above.  Compounding, generally, is the growth of principal investments due to the reinvestment of dividends without withdrawing funds from the account. Acorns investment accounts do not pay interest, so the impact of compounding may be limited. It is not an investing strategy and does not assure positive performance nor does it protect against losses. It does not take into account market volatility and fluctuations that will impact the value of any investment account.  The ETFs comprising the portfolios charge fees and expenses that will reduce a client\u2019s return. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF\u2019s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.  1  Early Payday depends on timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer and fraud prevention restrictions.

Timing may vary.  2  Acorns also offers an  Acorns Checking deposit account . Acorns Checking accounts are issued by Lincoln Savings Bank, Member FDIC, and are FDIC insured up to $250,000. Acorns Visa\u2122 debit cards are issued by Lincoln Savings Bank, member FDIC for Acorns Checking account holders. \u00a0 \"Save and Invest\"  claim refers to a client's ability to utilize the Acorns Checking Real-Time Round-up feature to invest small amounts of money from purchases made using an Acorns Checking account, and seamlessly investing those small amounts using an Acorns Investment account. \u00a0Requires both an active Acorns Checking account and an Acorns Investment account in good standing. \u00a0 Real-Time Round-Ups\u00ae  are accrued instantly for investment during the next trading window.

Such results do not represent actual results and do not take into consideration economic or market factors which can impact performance. Actual clients may achieve investment results materially different from the results portrayed.  Round-Ups\u00ae  investments are transferred from your linked funding source (checking account) to your Acorns Invest account, where the funds are invested into a portfolio of selected ETFs. If you do not maintain an adequate amount of funds in your funding source sufficient to cover your Round-Ups\u00ae investments, you could incur overdraft fees with your financial institution. \u00a0Only purchases made with a funding source linked to your Acorns account with the feature active are eligible for the Round- Ups\u00ae feature. Please note that a properly suggested  portfolio recommendation  is dependent upon current and accurate financial and risk profiles.

It does not take into account market volatility and fluctuations that will impact the value of any investment account.  The ETFs comprising the portfolios charge fees and expenses that will reduce a client\u2019s return.

Important Disclosures: \u00a0Investing involves risk, including loss of principal.  \u00a0Past performance does not guarantee or indicate future results. \u00a0Please consider, among other important factors, your investment objectives, risk tolerance and Acorns pricing before investing. \u00a0 Diversification  and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit, nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal. \u00a0 It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  \u00a0Any  hypothetical performance  shown is for illustrative purposes only. Such results do not represent actual results and do not take into consideration economic or market factors which can impact performance. Actual clients may achieve investment results materially different from the results portrayed.  Round-Ups\u00ae  investments are transferred from your linked funding source (checking account) to your Acorns Invest account, where the funds are invested into a portfolio of selected ETFs. If you do not maintain an adequate amount of funds in your funding source sufficient to cover your Round-Ups\u00ae investments, you could incur overdraft fees with your financial institution. \u00a0Only purchases made with a funding source linked to your Acorns account with the feature active are eligible for the Round- Ups\u00ae feature. Please note that a properly suggested  portfolio recommendation  is dependent upon current and accurate financial and risk profiles. Clients who have experienced changes to their goals, financial circumstances or investment objectives, or who wish to modify their portfolio recommendation, should promptly update their information in the Acorns app or through the website.

Acorns reserves the right to restrict or revoke any and all offers at any time.  Acorns does not provide access to invest directly in Bitcoin . Bitcoin exposure is provided through the ETF BITO, which invests in Bitcoin futures. This is considered a high-risk investment given the speculative and volatile nature. Further information and risks available via the disclosure link above.  Compounding, generally, is the growth of principal investments due to the reinvestment of dividends without withdrawing funds from the account. Acorns investment accounts do not pay interest, so the impact of compounding may be limited. It is not an investing strategy and does not assure positive performance nor does it protect against losses. It does not take into account market volatility and fluctuations that will impact the value of any investment account.  The ETFs comprising the portfolios charge fees and expenses that will reduce a client\u2019s return. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF\u2019s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.  1  Early Payday depends on timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer and fraud prevention restrictions.

Important Disclosures: \u00a0Investing involves risk, including loss of principal.  \u00a0Past performance does not guarantee or indicate future results. \u00a0Please consider, among other important factors, your investment objectives, risk tolerance and Acorns pricing before investing. \u00a0 Diversification  and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit, nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal. \u00a0 It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  \u00a0Any  hypothetical performance  shown is for illustrative purposes only. Such results do not represent actual results and do not take into consideration economic or market factors which can impact performance. Actual clients may achieve investment results materially different from the results portrayed.  Round-Ups\u00ae  investments are transferred from your linked funding source (checking account) to your Acorns Invest account, where the funds are invested into a portfolio of selected ETFs. If you do not maintain an adequate amount of funds in your funding source sufficient to cover your Round-Ups\u00ae investments, you could incur overdraft fees with your financial institution. \u00a0Only purchases made with a funding source linked to your Acorns account with the feature active are eligible for the Round- Ups\u00ae feature. Please note that a properly suggested  portfolio recommendation  is dependent upon current and accurate financial and risk profiles. Clients who have experienced changes to their goals, financial circumstances or investment objectives, or who wish to modify their portfolio recommendation, should promptly update their information in the Acorns app or through the website.

Acorns reserves the right to restrict or revoke any and all offers at any time.  Acorns does not provide access to invest directly in Bitcoin . Bitcoin exposure is provided through the ETF BITO, which invests in Bitcoin futures. This is considered a high-risk investment given the speculative and volatile nature. Further information and risks available via the disclosure link above.  Compounding, generally, is the growth of principal investments due to the reinvestment of dividends without withdrawing funds from the account. Acorns investment accounts do not pay interest, so the impact of compounding may be limited. It is not an investing strategy and does not assure positive performance nor does it protect against losses. It does not take into account market volatility and fluctuations that will impact the value of any investment account.  The ETFs comprising the portfolios charge fees and expenses that will reduce a client\u2019s return. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF\u2019s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.  1  Early Payday depends on timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer and fraud prevention restrictions.

Important Disclosures: \u00a0Investing involves risk, including loss of principal.  \u00a0Past performance does not guarantee or indicate future results. \u00a0Please consider, among other important factors, your investment objectives, risk tolerance and Acorns pricing before investing. \u00a0 Diversification  and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit, nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal. \u00a0 It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  \u00a0Any  hypothetical performance  shown is for illustrative purposes only. Such results do not represent actual results and do not take into consideration economic or market factors which can impact performance. Actual clients may achieve investment results materially different from the results portrayed.  Round-Ups\u00ae  investments are transferred from your linked funding source (checking account) to your Acorns Invest account, where the funds are invested into a portfolio of selected ETFs. If you do not maintain an adequate amount of funds in your funding source sufficient to cover your Round-Ups\u00ae investments, you could incur overdraft fees with your financial institution. \u00a0Only purchases made with a funding source linked to your Acorns account with the feature active are eligible for the Round- Ups\u00ae feature. Please note that a properly suggested  portfolio recommendation  is dependent upon current and accurate financial and risk profiles. Clients who have experienced changes to their goals, financial circumstances or investment objectives, or who wish to modify their portfolio recommendation, should promptly update their information in the Acorns app or through the website. Actual  Acorns Earn  rewards investments are made by Acorns Grow, Inc. into your Acorns Invest account through a partnership Acorns Grow maintains with each Acorns Earn partner. \u00a0Acorns  Subscription Fees  are assessed based on the tier of services in which you are enrolled. \u00a0Acorns does not charge transactional fees, commissions or fees based on assets for accounts under $1 million.

Acorns reserves the right to restrict or revoke any and all offers at any time.  Acorns does not provide access to invest directly in Bitcoin . Bitcoin exposure is provided through the ETF BITO, which invests in Bitcoin futures. This is considered a high-risk investment given the speculative and volatile nature. Further information and risks available via the disclosure link above.  Compounding, generally, is the growth of principal investments due to the reinvestment of dividends without withdrawing funds from the account. Acorns investment accounts do not pay interest, so the impact of compounding may be limited. It is not an investing strategy and does not assure positive performance nor does it protect against losses. It does not take into account market volatility and fluctuations that will impact the value of any investment account.  The ETFs comprising the portfolios charge fees and expenses that will reduce a client\u2019s return. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF\u2019s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.  1  Early Payday depends on timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer and fraud prevention restrictions. Funds are generally available on the day the payment file is received, up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date. Timing may vary.  2  Acorns also offers an  Acorns Checking deposit account . Acorns Checking accounts are issued by Lincoln Savings Bank, Member FDIC, and are FDIC insured up to $250,000. Acorns Visa\u2122 debit cards are issued by Lincoln Savings Bank, member FDIC for Acorns Checking account holders. \u00a0 \"Save and Invest\"  claim refers to a client's ability to utilize the Acorns Checking Real-Time Round-up feature to invest small amounts of money from purchases made using an Acorns Checking account, and seamlessly investing those small amounts using an Acorns Investment account. \u00a0Requires both an active Acorns Checking account and an Acorns Investment account in good standing. \u00a0 Real-Time Round-Ups\u00ae  are accrued instantly for investment during the next trading window.

Important Disclosures: \u00a0Investing involves risk, including loss of principal.  \u00a0Past performance does not guarantee or indicate future results. \u00a0Please consider, among other important factors, your investment objectives, risk tolerance and Acorns pricing before investing. \u00a0 Diversification  and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit, nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal. \u00a0 It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  \u00a0Any  hypothetical performance  shown is for illustrative purposes only. Such results do not represent actual results and do not take into consideration economic or market factors which can impact performance. Actual clients may achieve investment results materially different from the results portrayed.  Round-Ups\u00ae  investments are transferred from your linked funding source (checking account) to your Acorns Invest account, where the funds are invested into a portfolio of selected ETFs. If you do not maintain an adequate amount of funds in your funding source sufficient to cover your Round-Ups\u00ae investments, you could incur overdraft fees with your financial institution. \u00a0Only purchases made with a funding source linked to your Acorns account with the feature active are eligible for the Round- Ups\u00ae feature. Please note that a properly suggested  portfolio recommendation  is dependent upon current and accurate financial and risk profiles. Clients who have experienced changes to their goals, financial circumstances or investment objectives, or who wish to modify their portfolio recommendation, should promptly update their information in the Acorns app or through the website.

Acorns reserves the right to restrict or revoke any and all offers at any time.  Acorns does not provide access to invest directly in Bitcoin . Bitcoin exposure is provided through the ETF BITO, which invests in Bitcoin futures. This is considered a high-risk investment given the speculative and volatile nature. Further information and risks available via the disclosure link above.  Compounding, generally, is the growth of principal investments due to the reinvestment of dividends without withdrawing funds from the account. Acorns investment accounts do not pay interest, so the impact of compounding may be limited. It is not an investing strategy and does not assure positive performance nor does it protect against losses. It does not take into account market volatility and fluctuations that will impact the value of any investment account.  The ETFs comprising the portfolios charge fees and expenses that will reduce a client\u2019s return. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF\u2019s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.  1  Early Payday depends on timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer and fraud prevention restrictions.
